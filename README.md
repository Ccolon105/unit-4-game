# unit-4-game
Crystal Collector

Instructions

    You will be given a random number at the start of the game.

    There are four crystals below. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your total score.

    You win the game by matching your total score to the random number, you lose the game if your total score goes above the random number.

    The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.

    Each time when the game starts, the game will change the values of each crystal.    

This project is helpful becasue it is a fun and simple excersice to evaluate the use of Jquerry to create a game. This project was very difficult for a newbie like myself. I was able to cobble this code together, as well as rearrange and troubleshoot based on the vast resources of the internet.
